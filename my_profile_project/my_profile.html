    <h1>Zach Gonzalez's Webpage</h1>
    <h2>Welcome everybody!</h2>
    <p>My name is <span class="bluetext" id="zachtag"> Zach Gonzalez</span>, and a lot of my friends call me Gonzo.
      I was born in Calabasas, California, moved to Nashville, TN when I was 9, and eventually moved to Chicago before my junior year when I was 16. I graduated from Latin School of Chicago. This fall I will be attending Swarthmore College and playing on the baseball team there. (This website happens to be in the Swarthmore school colors of garnet and grey.) I love sports, and I play baseball and basketball. I also love listening to music. I'll listen to anything good really, but my favorite genre is rap. I have a dog named Buddy (with a really original name), and he is the best. Check out the picture below.</p>
